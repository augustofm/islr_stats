Two: Deciding on Important Variables
Various statistics can be used to judge the quality of a model. These include Mallows' Cpm Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and adjusted R2.
Check differences between forward selection, backward seletion and mixed selection.

What is contrast for Linear Regression?

Hierarquical principle: If we include an interaction in a model, we should also include the main effects,even if the p-values associated with their coefficients are not significant.

Bayes estimation leads to the lowest prediction error, so having a LDA error close to the Bayes one would mean a good model fit, however it takes into account a threshold of 0.5 for the class probabilities, and for many cases we are much more 
insterested in True positive rates for both classes. ROC curve 
can be used for different threshold to check that problem.
QDA performs better than LDA when the bayes decision boundary is not linear, so that the two Gaussians classes do not share a common correlation. 
QDA estimates a separate covariance matrix for each class, for a total of Kp(p+1)/2 parameters. K times the LDA number, but it may be worth it if the boundary is not linear.


When the true decision boundaries are linear, then the LDA and ogistic regression approaches will tend to perform well. When the boundaries are moderately non-linear, QDA ma give better results. Finally, for much more complicated decision boundaries, a non-parametric approach such as KNN can be superior. But the level of smoothness for a non-parametric approach must be chosen carefully.
