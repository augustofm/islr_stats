## Conceptual

# 1. 
# Best subset. forward stepwise and backward stepwise
# Obtaining p+1 models, containing 0, 1, 2..., p predictors.
# 
# a) Best subset, because the chance of finding models that look
# good on the training data is high, even though they might not 
# have any predictive power on future data.
# b) Forward stepwise and backward stepwise have the smallest 
# testing RSS because in the end it will select the best fit before 
# using all the p number of predictors
# c) i.FALSE ii.TRUE iii.FALSE iv.TRUE v.TRUE

# 2.
# Bias - Variance trade off in R
# http://web.as.uky.edu/statistics/users/pbreheny/603.R

# a(i), b(i), c(i) 
# Sice variance decreases and consequentely, 
# bias increases.

# 3. CHECK
# (a) ii or iii
# (b) i or iv
# (c) iv
# (d) iii
# (e) v
